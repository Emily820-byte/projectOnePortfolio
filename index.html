        <p>Hello, my name is Emily Zhao. This self-portrait is a Fauvist style portrait that I designed 
        myself from a previous class using Photoshop. Currently, I’m in my second year at SFSU. I'm majoring
        in Visual Communications with a minor in Comic Studies. I live in Sunnyvale, California with my
        parents, my grandma, my twin sister, and my dog. I transferred here from West Valley College. My 
        hobbies include arts and crafts, watching YouTube videos, reading, and playing games on my phone. 
        I own my own Etsy shop where I sell my arts and crafts. I sell mostly pendant necklaces and 
        customized Littlest Pet Shop toys. My dream is to make my own superhero comics, like Stan Lee. I 
        decided to major in Design because I love art. However, many things nowadays are done online and 
        using technology, so I decided I had to keep up with the trend. After all, I’d have a better 
        chance at finding a job that involves tech rather than plain oil painting or pencil drawing. Despite 
        being ethnically Chinese, I’m one hundred percent American, being born and raised here in the U.S. 
        I cannot read Mandarin and can barely speak the language. I don't even like Chinese food. </p>
