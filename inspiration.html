        She is a makeup guru, artist, and entrepreneur on YouTube. She 
        inspires me because we are very similar in that we both love makeup, 
        art, and fashion. One key thing about her is that she doesn't see 
        makeup as a way to hide under. On the contrary, she sees it as a way 
        to express herself. Both of us love makeup 
        because to us, it's like drawing, except it's on our faces.

        He was the creator of Marvel Comics and created so many superheroes, from the Fantastic Four, to the Avengers, to Spider-Man.
         He inspires me to chase my dreams of making my own superhero comics and making my superheroes as unique as I can. His own 
         unique hero was Spider-Man, who was unlike any superhero at that time.

        The channel is run by Latoya Moore-Broyles and her daughter Bella, often referred to as "Froggy, and Little Froggy" on the channel.
        I find inspiration from the channel because I love arts and crafts and often make similar things to the channel during my free 
        time. I use MyFroggyStuff as a way to improve my crafts and as a challenge to try to make things from everyday objects, 
        such as bottle caps or cardboard boxes.
